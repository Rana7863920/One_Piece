                        Eiichiro Oda's One Piece is one of the most popular shonen series in anime history. 
                        One Piece&apos;s incredible popularity positioned it as a part of the previous “Big Three.” 
                        The story follows Monkey D. Luffy on his journey to fulfill his dream of becoming the 
                        Pirate King.

                        As the current holder of the Gomu Gomu no Mi Devil Fruit, Luffy develops his skills as 
                        a rubber man and conquers the pirate seas as the Straw Hat Pirate captain. One Piece 
                        earned its popularity through its detailed storyline, exciting characters, and creative 
                        settings. Premiering in 1999, its animation and characters have grown over the past 2 
                        decades. One Piece continues to inspire audiences worldwide and has no signs of slowing 
                        down anytime soon.

                        rules its set in place. The vivre card was introduced when Ace gave Luffy a small piece of paper 
                        and told him to hold onto without explaining its importance.
                        <br><br>
                        It was later explained that the vivre cards hold a person’s life force. 
                        A vivre card moves in the direction of its owner and someone can locate them when using it. 
                        In a comedic and entertaining display of the vivre cards power, Nami used Big Mom’s vivre card 
                        to scare her “homies” into helping her.

                        Fans are deeply attached to several One Piece characters. With the amount of intriguing identities 
                        Oda has created, there are many fan favorites. Typically viewers fall in love with the protagonist 
                        and claim them as their favorite character – One piece makes that difficult. Audiences admire Zoro’s
                        loyalty, Sanji’s charm, Chopper’s compassion, Robin’s tenderness, Nami’s practicality, Franky’s 
                        quirks, and Jinbe’s humility, just as much as they admire Luffy's kindness and determination.

                        Each Straw Hat has an important role to play and they make their crew stronger. Aside from the

                        hearts as well. Everyone has grown exponentially since the start of the series and it’s exciting

                    <p>
                        Filler episodes are used to slow down the main storyline in order to give manga artists more time. 
                        Though manga illustrations take a significant amount of time, fans would rather wait than be forced 
                        to quench their anime thirst with unnecessary plots. One Piece should be applauded for its ability 
                        to limit the amount of filler its produced. 
                        <br><br>
                        As an older anime, it’s impressive that One Piece didn’t follow suit and bombard its fanbase 
                        with filler to get more time. Though One Piece isn't completely devoid of filler, the filler 
                        that is animated coincide with the cover arcs produced in the manga, which focuses on several 
                        side characters.

                        One Piece has an incredible way of giving fans information about important pieces of the story 
                        without them knowing. By giving techniques a different name or mentioning it in passing during 
                        fast paced sequences, fans aren’t aware of pertinent information they've received that will play 
                        a bigger role later.

                        During Luffy’s fight with Crocodile in Alabasta, Luffy needed to combat Crocodile’s Sand-Sand 
                        Fruit with liquid. He used his blood which Crocodile mistook for Haki. Fans weren’t introduced 
                        to Haki yet, but it was always present. When Rayleigh taught Luffy about Haki, he thought about 
                        where he saw it used before, Amazon Lily and Skypeia.

                        One Piece has introduced several characters throughout its 23 year run. Most of these characters 
                        have unique powers or are in possession of a Devil Fruit. With the amount of characters Oda has 
                        created, granting most of them unique abilities is nothing short of impressive. 
                        After fans became familiar with Haki, they learned there were different types: Observation,
                        Armorment, and Conquers.
                        <br><br>
                        Observation allows the user to feel other’s presence, Amorment gives the user invisible armor, 
                        and Conquers Haki allows the user to impress their will onto others. If this incredible gift 
                        wasn't enough, there’s also Devil Fruits. Devil Fruits are fruits that give a person special 
                        abilities once they ingest it. There are innumerable Devil Fruit users in One Piece. While some 
                        are more powerful than others, it’s always interesting to see a new user.

                        located all around the world. After airing for over two decades, One Piece is even more exciting

                        represents corresponding countries in real life. Luffy is said to be from Brazil, while Ussop is

                        Though anime is an entertainment medium, it’s inspiring to see writers use their platforms to 
                        bring attention to relevant, real-life issues. One Piece discusses poverty, political corruption,
                        and racism through the Marines, Celestial Dragons, Royal Families, and Fishmen. 
                        Prejudice is conveyed through the relationship between Fishmen and humans. Fishmen 
                        didn’t trust humans.
                        <br><br>
                        As a result, they created laws to help limit their interactions. When Luffy was injured on 
                        Fishman Island he needed a blood transfusion. However, sharing blood with a human was 
                        forbidden. Jinbe ignored this law and volunteered to give Luffy his blood. The scene shows
                        Jinbe’s blood leave his body and flow towards Luffy in an emotional illustration of dismantling 
                        prejudice. As Luffy smiles, a voice announces, “If you hurt someone, or someone hurts you, 
                        the same red blood will shed.”

                        One Piece recently celebrated airing it’s thousandth episode. With two decades of animation under its belt, 
                        One Piece has impressed fans with its extraordinary attention to detail. Fans are often surprised at the 
                        information they received before understanding its importance. Oden‘s character exemplifies the intricacies 
                        of Oda's writing.
                        <br><br>
                        After seeing the events that led up to the Akazaya Nine's long-awaited battle against Kaido, 
                        fans were astonished and impressed to see that many of the new characters they’ve become 
                        acquainted with have always been there. Izou left Wano to stop Oden from joining Whitebeard's 
                        pirate crew. In an ironic turn of events, he ended up staying with Oden and becoming a beloved 
                        member aboard the Moby Dick. If fans were to go back and watch the Marine Ford War, they would 
                        see that Izou was also there pleading with Ace to return to the ship. This is one of several 
                        examples of how Oda never adds pointless details and ties his storylines together.
